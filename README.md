Programming Assignment 1, Part 1

A. Required elements
- Use either the arrow keys or "WASD" to tilt the board
- The goal of the game is to move the ball into the green circle to win.
- Hit 'Q' or ESC to quit
- Hit 'R' to restart

B. Additional elements

C. Known issues
- Trying to quit the game by using 'Q' or ESC will not work in the Unity editor mode. According to some posts on Unity Answers, this will only work in an executable of the game.
- Similarly, the lighting dims after restarting the game in editor mode, but works correctly in an executable.

D. External resources
- I used the public Unity Answers forum, Unity tutorials, and went to office hours.
- For the first programming assignment, I used this youtube tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fZnwmcdAR8
